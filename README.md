## Description
Week-1-Challenges: Toy Problems
This is my first attempt on the three challenges.

Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator
This is used to create a calculator with input as the student's score and output as the grade scored.
The challenge is solved using the if---else loop statements to mee the conditions and ouput the grades as follows:
```
A > 79
B - 60 to 79
C - 59 to 49
D - 40 to 49
E - less than 40
```

Challenge 2: Speed Detector
This project focused on assessing the speed of a car.
The allowed speed limit is 70.
if driver's speed is <= 70: output is 'ok'
if driver's speed is > 70: gets demerit points .
    if demerit points > 12: 'License is Suspended.

Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator
This challenge involves creating a program that calculate's one's net salary.
The input is basic salary.
Calculation of deductions:
    Tax
    NHIF Deductions
    NSSF Deductions
The output is the net salary after deductions.
